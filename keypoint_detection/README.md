## keypoint detection
In this project, we used the [High Resolution Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09212) as our keypoint detector. We modify the original structure to output both mask and keypoint in the last layer. Please refer to the original [project website](https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch) for more details on their software and license.
